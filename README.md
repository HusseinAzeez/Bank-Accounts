# Why are the customers leaving the bank?

The customers in a big bank started to close their accounts for an unknown reason, 
the bank management trying to understand what is the reason for that 
by understanding the correlations between the data variables, 
such as, Age, Gender, Balanced, etc, however, I used an Artifical Neural Network on their dataset for that purpose. 


Here are some dataset characteristics:

          The dataset contains 10,000 instances.

          Split into 2 datasets:

                    1- Training set contains 8,000 rows.
          
                    2- Testing set contains 2,000 rows.

          The accuracy for the incoming data is 86%.

The correct predication for the testing set is (1,725 from 2,000) customers.
